Install IntelliJ IDEA

   Download IntelliJ IDEA for your operating system from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html.
   Do the following depending on your operating system:
   	Windows:
   		Run the ideaIC.exe or the ideaIU.exe file you have downloaded.

   	macOS:
   		Double-click the ideaIC.dmg or ideaIU.dmg file you have downloaded to mount the macOS disk image.
   		Copy IntelliJ IDEA to the Applications folder.

   	Linux:
   		Unpack the ideaIC.gz or ideaIU.gz file you have downloaded to a different folder if your current Downloads folder doesn't support file execution:
   			tar xfz ideaIC.tar.gz or ideaIU.tar.gz. <new_archive_folder>
   		The recommended install location according to the filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS) is /opt. For example, it's possible to enter the following command:

   			sudo tar xf -*.tar.gz -C /opt/
   		Switch to the bin directory, for example:
   			cd /opt/-*/bin
   		Run idea.sh from the bin subdirectory.

   	Linux:
   		Installing the 64-bit JDK on a Linux platform:
   			Download the file, jdk-10.interim.update.patch_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz.
   			Before you download a file, you must accept the license agreement. The archive binary can be installed by anyone (not only by root users) in any location that you can write to.
   			The .tar.gz archive file (also called a tarball) is a file that can be simultaneously uncompressed and extracted in one step.

   			Change the directory to the location where you want to install the JDK, then move the .tar.gz archive binary to the current directory.
   			Unpack the tarball and install the JDK:
   				$ tar zxvf jdk-10.interim.update.patch_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

   			The Java Development Kit files are installed in a directory called jdk-10.interim.update.patch in the current directory.

   		Installing the 64-Bit JDK on RPM-Based Linux Platforms:
   			Log in as a root user to perform this installation.
   			Download the file, jdk-10.interim.update.patch_linux-x64_bin.rpm.
   			Before you download a file, you must accept the license agreement.

   			Ensure that you have root user access by running the command su and entering the superuser password.
   			Install the package using the following command:
   				$ rpm -ivh jdk-10.interim.update.patch_linux-x64_bin.rpm

   			Note:
   				JDK 10 can coexist with earlier versions of JDK. For each version, a new directory is created, the default directory being /usr/java/jdk.interim.update.patch.

   			Upgrade the package using the following command:
   				$ rpm -Uvh jdk-10.interim.update.patch_linux-x64_bin.rpm
